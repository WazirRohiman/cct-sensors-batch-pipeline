def normalize_to_tall(parquet_path: str, dest_dir: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Normalize a staged Parquet dataset into a tall-format Parquet file.
    
    Reads sensor data from the provided staged Parquet file or directory, pivots/widens
    as needed to produce a tall (long) schema, standardizes units and timestamps,
    and writes a normalized Parquet file into dest_dir, returning the output path.
    
    Parameters:
        parquet_path (str): Path to the staged Parquet file or directory to read.
        dest_dir (str): Destination directory where the normalized Parquet will be written.
    
    Returns:
        Optional[str]: Path to the written normalized Parquet file on success, or None on failure.
    
    Notes:
        This function is currently a stub and not yet implemented; it presently returns None.
